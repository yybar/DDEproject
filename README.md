This code contains DDEServerClass.py and waveFrontWServer.py.  The DDEServerClass.py specifies a class when instantiated sets up a dynamic link with ZEMAX using the win32 protocol, which provides asscess to a set of programmable extensions in ZEMAX.  The waveFrontWServer.py utilizes the class in a wavefront read in example.  This has been used to simulate the active optical control of the JWST wavefront commissioning process.
